Cedar Design System provides predefined spacing values that help reduce redundancy, declutter prototypes and style sheets, and utilize common terminology.

By design, Cedar elements are self contained and provide no spacing outside of their border and box shadows. This means that content elements will not stack one on top of another without the use of spacing elements.

## Concepts

### Box Model

The Cedar spacing system is built around HTML’s foundational layout principle known as the **box model**. Every webpage is made of boxes and includes the ‘box within a box’ structure. The graphic below shows how the box model defines the structure and layout for all elements on a page.
