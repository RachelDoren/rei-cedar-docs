## Motion
Cedar motion is purposefully designed to enhance the customer's understanding of REI’s digital products. Cedar components use animation for transitions, feedback, and demonstrations to reduce cognitive load and give customer experiences a natural interactivity. It’s an important part of building customer trust and affinity for our products.

Use motion to celebrate the playful aspects of our brand and tell compelling stories about the outdoors.

### Timing
Animated components use short time durations so interactions feel responsive and succinct. Striking a balance is key: slow enough to comprehend – fast enough to respect the  customer’s time.

### Easing
Cedar’s collection of easings are based on physics found in the natural world. They respond quickly when invoked and slow down over time to ease into their final position. This communicates a sense of physicality and reflects the customer's expectation of objects moving in the real world.
