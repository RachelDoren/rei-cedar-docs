## About Cedar

Cedar is REI’s Design System: a foundational tool built to serve the design and engineering of digital products. It is REI’s digital visual language built into accessible UI components and token variables, offered as dual Vue-based code and Sketch design assets with full documentation.

<cdr-img :src="$withBase(`/about/cedar1.png`)" alt="Cedar provides design assets for sketch, Vue.js components and the documentation to use them."/>

The Cedar design system promotes reusability of modular components to spread a more unified and cohesive customer experience across our enterprise of digital product development teams and enable more effective design communication.

### Community

The system is made by the core Cedar team & REI digital community, intended for use by all teams making web-based digital experiences.

Cedar has a core team of designers and front-end engineers that are dedicated to developing and supporting the system. Contributions from the greater design and engineering community at REI are encouraged to help grow and evolve the system.

In the spirit of creating a collaborative community around the design system, the Cedar team will host demos and reviews that will be open to any interested parties, and participate in vertical team meetings for deeper dives into specific topics. 

#### Open Source

While Cedar is primarily focused on serving teams building experiences for REI, the system is also available as an open source project in GitHub and NPM.

Fonts used in the Cedar Design System are licensed and proprietary to REI, and are not for usage by unapproved parties. 

For more information or questions regarding Cedar’s support for external consumers using the open source project, please reach out to [cedar@rei.com](mailto:cedar@rei.com).  

### Vision & Goals

#### Vision

The Cedar Design System unifies design and development with a common language and toolset, enabling teams to create and iterate faster while maintaining a cohesive customer experience. 

#### Goals

As a future-friendly foundation for REI’s digital portfolio, Cedar is an internal product built to serve REI product teams by enabling them to work faster, more efficiently, and with higher quality. In order to do this, we are focused on the following goals:

- Systemize the interfaces across the portfolio
- Enable a consistent customer experience by promoting visual cohesion at scale
- Reduce costs of duplicative work and allow teams to focus their time on creating great customer experiences 
- Streamline time to market by increasing the speed of prototyping and development
- Allow better cross-functional collaboration with a common language and standards
