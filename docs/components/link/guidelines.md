## Use when

*   Navigating to another page or a different portion of the same page

### Don't use when

*   Triggering an action other than navigation. Instead, use [Button](Future-Link--Button.html)
*   Navigating a user from promotional or campaign content. Instead, use [Call-to-action](Future-Link--Call-To-Action.html)

## Foundations

*   Display a blue link style by default, adding an underline on hover
*   Accepted text/color pairings can be found in the [Color](Future-Link--Color.html) documentation
()
*   Always underline Links within paragraphs increase scan-ability and accessibility

*   Link styles are adapted based on context and needed affordance, such as for Links included in the [Breadcrumb](http://TBD-breadcrumb.html), [Menus](http://TBD-menus.html) and [Navigation](http://TBD-navigation.html) component

## Behavior

## Accessibility

*   Always present Link with a Level AA contrast ratio of:

*   4.5:1 contrast between the link text color and the background
*   3:1 contrast between the link text color and the surrounding non-link text color

*   Always distinguish a Link's underline and color from surrounding text
*   Match hover and focus states to ensure the same visual presentation when keyboard users navigate or 'tab' to the link
