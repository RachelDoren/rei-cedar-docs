## CdrA


src/components/anchor/cdrA.vue


Cedar 2 component for anchor.



Modifying classes: {button, contrast, standalone}



Use of the 'button' modifier depends on including the css for cdrButton.



A modifier list that contains 'button' exposes the same modifiers as

cdrButton and the other modifiers shouldn't be combined with it.
