<span class="file">src/components/anchor/cdrA.vue<span>


Cedar 2 component for anchor.



<span class="modifiers">Modifiers</span>



Modifiers can be combined 1 from each grouping.

{contrast, standalone} **OR** button

Use of the 'button' modifier depends on including the css for cdrButton.

A modifier list that contains 'button' exposes the same modifiers as cdrButton and the other modifiers shouldn't be combined with it.

### <button class='title'>PROPS, METHODS, EVENTS, SLOTS</button>

Slot | Description
--- | ---
default | innerHTML on the inside of the anchor component
